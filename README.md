# frc2019-java
Java code for Team 2429's 2019 Robot

This contains all of the updates for the 2019 robot.  It's bigger than than previous eclipse-based years because MS code/wpilib now includes all of the dlls in the package itself.

## Installation

To install the current code download the latest release of the repository either by zip or using git clone (it's the green button up top).
Then you can open up the folder in MS Visual Code, which can be gotten from https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc

### git-bash shell

Download git-scm from https://git-scm.com/. Install on your system and you will then have access
to the git-bash shell which is better than the command line.  You only need this if you want to contribute changes from home.
