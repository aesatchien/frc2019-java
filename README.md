# frc2019-java
Java code for Team 2429's 2019 Robot

This contains all of the updates for the 2019 robot.  It's bigger than than previous eclipse-based years because MS code/wpilib now includes all of the dlls in the package itself.

## Installation

To install the current release download the latest release of the repository either by zip or using git clone.

### git-bash shell

Download git-scm from https://git-scm.com/. Install on your system and you will then have access
to the git-bash shell which is better than the command line.
